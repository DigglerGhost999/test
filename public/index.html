<h1>goblins</h1>
<p>Goblins originally come from a barren place where survival is almost futile with no food and water; they are constantly in a cycle of pain.Then the Maelstrom happens and they emerge from one of  the cracks it caused. Seeing how other races lived in comfort with a bed to sleep in and food in their stomachs, made them jealous and angry and that anger flipped a switch in their brain causing them to become ruthless, cunning beasts with their only goal to end the existence of all races.</p>
<p>Goblins are small frail humanoid monsters that are extremely cunning and smart compared to the monster races, they prefer to be in hordes of their own and are usually seen using small weapons made by them or scavenged from the battlefield. They found home in Boundless Forest  where they live in a big tribunal village whose location is not known to any of the races and those who come close soon lose their lives .</p>
